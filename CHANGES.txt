Changelog of lizard-flooding
===================================================


1.0 (2010-04-21)
----------------

- Added "old" flooding as lizard_flooding.

- Also added "old" visualization and presentation into this very same python
  package as lizard_visualization and lizard_presentation.  WARNING: there are
  now three django apps in one python package.  Necessary as the code was
  pretty much intertwined.

- Initial library skeleton created by nensskel.
