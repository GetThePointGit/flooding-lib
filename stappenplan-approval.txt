For the approval _status_:
- Add boolean field 'approved_by_owner' to Scenario
- Let set_status() update it
- Look for code that checks for a scenario being approved, change it
  to look at the new field
- Find all code that uses the tasks to change approval, let it change
  the field directly
- Remove the dependency on tasks, remove the approval tasks
BUT: What will happen to the other statuses? Needs more
thinking. Maybe we should just keep it like this. But move the code
that does it into Scenario.


For the approval objects:
- Make a new method 'approval_object_for(project)' for Scenario
- Let it return the Scenario's approval object
- Find all places that use the approval object, let them use the new
  method (hopefully with some concept of which project -- or all
  projects)
- Look at the code that creates approval objects, let them go through
  a method with a project argument too
- Move the field to ScenarioProject, let the methods use the correct
  approval object
